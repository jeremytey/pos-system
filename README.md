# Sales Receipts (IndexedDB POS App)

A simple browser-based point-of-sale (POS) application built with vanilla JavaScript and IndexedDB.  
This project stores sales receipts locally in the browser and persists data across sessions without any backend.

Perfect for practicing:
- IndexedDB (transactions, object stores, async flow)
- DOM rendering patterns
- State management
- ES modules
- Clean separation of concerns
